One of the most challenging things about this project is to measure success.  I define the success metric $F(Rating, Number\_Reviews, Time)$. The paramterization of this function, however, is far from clear.

## Desired Traits of the Function
The function should have the following traits:

1. A business that has been open for a long time and has a high rating should probably count as successful because it has stayed open for a long time and the people who review it like it. It could just be a low-volume, high-margin business or it could be that the people who frequent the establishment do not submit yelp views often. 
2. A business with a large number of reviews and high rating should always be rated as successful.
3. A business with high numbers of reviews over a short amount of time should be successful regardless of ratings because they are clearly making money despite the pitiful reviews. 


## standardize:

It makes sense to standardize 

- It also makes sense to come up with a metric that is Reviews/Time.
