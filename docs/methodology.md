# The Process
1. Defining an ideal success matric
2. Train a model that predicts the success of (1)
3. Build the Web App

# Defining the Ideal Success Metric
I define the success metric as $F(Rating, Number\_Reviews, Time)$ .  
# Features
1. LDA Topics
2. Key Words
3. Location
4. Other Geographic features
    - Distance from beloved businesses (bars, movies, casinos)
5. City
6. Sentiment
7. Count of adverbs
8. ngrams

# Measuring Success
A major challenge 

# Problems encountered

# A word on market saturation
A worry with this model is that it makes the implicit assumption that a location that has been successful for other similar businesses
is unlikely to be successful for yet another because the market has become (more) saturated. This is usually less of a worry than intuition suggests. 
In fact, it is often optimal for similar (and thus competing) businesses to compete together (see [Central Place Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_place_theory))

In a future iteration, I will include neighborhoods that are close to the successful neighborhood to combat this worry.


# The Presentation
1. Make substantial use of GIFs to demonstrate the Web App
